==============================================

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights to monitor the real-world performance of the portfolio website.

Changes Made:
-------------

1. **Installed Package**
   - Added @vercel/speed-insights v1.3.1 to dependencies using pnpm
   - Package manager: pnpm v10.30.1
   - Updated pnpm-lock.yaml with new dependency resolution

2. **Modified Files**
   - client/package.json: Added @vercel/speed-insights to dependencies
   - client/pnpm-lock.yaml: Updated lock file with new package and its dependencies
   - client/src/app/layout.tsx: Added SpeedInsights component to root layout

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Imported SpeedInsights from '@vercel/speed-insights/next' (optimized for Next.js 15.2.8 App Router)
   - Added <SpeedInsights /> component inside the <body> tag, after the ThemeProvider and children
   - Follows Next.js 13.5+ App Router pattern (project uses Next.js 15.2.8)
   - Component is automatically rendered on all pages through the root layout

Verification:
-------------
✓ Linter passed with no new errors
✓ Build completed successfully  
✓ All 66 tests passed (6 test files)

Technical Notes:
----------------
- The SpeedInsights component will automatically collect Core Web Vitals (CLS, FID, LCP, etc.)
- Data will be visible in the Vercel dashboard when deployed
- Zero configuration required - works out of the box with Next.js App Router
- No impact on bundle size for non-Vercel deployments (tree-shaken away)
- Preserves existing code structure and styling
